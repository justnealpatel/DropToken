# DropToken
A CLI that simulates a two-player game of Drop Token.

## Usage

You must have Python 3 installed (doesnâ€™t matter which specific version but just needs to be 3.0+). Use the following to run the program

- Open your terminal or command prompt
- Run `ls` and if you see `DropToken.py`, you're in the right place
- Run `python DropToken.py`
- Now you will be able to go through the game. Type `HELP` for available commands.
